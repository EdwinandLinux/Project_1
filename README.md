# User Account Management Script

## Overview
This script automates the process of managing user accounts on Linux systems. It was created in response to requests from the help desk team to handle account deletions while preserving home directories.  

The goal is to:
- Delete or disable accounts for employees who have changed departments or are on extended leave.
- Backup home directories to ensure data is retained if the user returns.
- Provide an efficient and repeatable process to reduce manual work.

By automating these tasks, the help desk team can handle future requests more easily without needing to perform manual account management each time.
